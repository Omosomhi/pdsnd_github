### Date created
The original bikeshare project was initiated on September 10, 2023. Subsequently, I updated the project and its associated README file on September 16, 2023.


### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Project (Udacity Python Project)

### Description
I designed this Python script specifically to fulfill the requirements of the second Project in Udacity's Introduction to Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Programme (PDND). In this exciting project, I embarked on a journey using Python to dive into the world of bike share systems across three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I had the opportunity to craft code that not only imported the data but also unlocked intriguing insights through the magic of descriptive statistics. To top it off, I developed a user-friendly script that welcomed raw input, transforming the terminal into an interactive hub where users could seamlessly explore and visualize these statistical gems.
### Files used
I used three datasets for my project:


a. chicago.csv: Contains bike share data for Chicago, provided by Udacity.


b. new_york_city.csv: Holds bike share data for New York, also from Udacity.


c. washington.csv: Specifically for Washington, another Udacity-provided dataset, but it lacks 'Gender' and 'Birth Year' data.
### Credits
I found two valuable sources of support during this project:


a. Pandas Docs: The pandas documentation proved to be an invaluable resource, providing crucial insights into the implementation of pandas methods utilized in this project.


b. Udacity: Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and the guidance of its instructors played a pivotal role in my project's success, offering invaluable assistance throughout my journey.
